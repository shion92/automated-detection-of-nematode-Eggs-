# Automated Detection of Nematode Eggs

This repository contains the main scripts and documentation for an automated deep learning system to detect nematode eggs in microscopic images. The project was developed in collaboration with Lincoln University (Christchurch, NZ), in partnership with the Department of Agricultural Sciences, which focused on improving livestock health research, the goal was to streamline the egg detection process through a computer vision-based solution.

The project supports training, fine-tuning, evaluation, prediction, and visualisation for Faster R-CNN, YOLOv8s and DeepLabV3+ models.

## Main Components

### 1. **Data Preparation for Training **
- Script in `Helper/` to split raw data into train/val/test sets 
- Convert images to formats that suitable for training (e.g., Pascal VOC XML to YOLO readable .txt, etc.).

### 2. **Model Training & Tuning**
- **Faster R-CNN:**  
  - `Faster_rcnn/faster_rcnn.py` for training and fine-tuning with different learning rates and backbones.
- **YOLOv8:**  
  - `YOLO/yolo_training.py` for training YOLOv8 models with various hyperparameters and optimisers.
- **DeepLabV3+:**  
  - `DeepLab/deeplab_training.py` for segmentation training.

### 3. **Inference & Prediction**
- `inference_faster_rcnn.py` for example, is a script for running inference on trained models and saving predictions. It is built to run inference separately if needed, which usually is already integrated into the training pipeline. 
- Outputs are typically saved in `/Processed_Images`

### 4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
- `DeepLab/evaluate_visual_deeplab.py`, `faster_rcnn/evaluate_visual_faster_cnn.py` etc for evaluating predictions (precision, recall, F1, mAP, PR curves). Outputs are typically saved in `evaluation`.
- For YOLO, TensorBoard was used to compare different YOLO model variants. See more https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started

## How to Use
**Install Dependencies**

Ensure Python 3.11.9 is installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
## Debug notes

- Adjust paths and hyperparameters as needed for your experiments.
- Refers to Helper/label_instruction.md if you have any questions around labeling.
